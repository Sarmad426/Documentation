# Next js

Next.js is a React framework that enables you to create full-stack web applications by extending
the latest React features and integrating powerful Rust-based JavaScript tooling for the fastest builds.

## Data Cache

Next.js has a built-in Data Cache that persists the result of data fetches across incoming server requests and deployments.
This is possible because Next.js extends the native fetch API to allow each request on the server to set its own persistent
caching semantics.
